<a name="introduction"><h3>Introduction</h3><a>





<p>
The Molecular Modelling Toolkit (MMTK)
presents a new approach to molecular simulations. It is not a
"simulation program" with a certain set of functions that can be used
by writing more or less flexible "input files", but a collection of
library modules written in an easy-to-learn high-level programming
language, <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. This approach
offers three important advantages:
<ul>


<li> <p>
Application programs can use the full power of a general and well-designed
programming language.
</p>

<li> <p>
Application programs can profit from the large set of other libraries
that are available for Python. These may be scientific or
non-scientific; for example, it is very easy to write simulation or
analysis programs with graphical user interfaces (using the module
<tt>Tkinter</tt> in the Python standard library),
or couple scientific calculations with a Web server.
</p>

<li> <p>
Any user can provide useful additions in separate modules, whereas adding
features to a monolithic program requires at least the cooperation of
the original author.
</p>

</ul>

To further encourage collaborative code development, MMTK uses a very
unrestrictive licensing policy, just like Python. Although MMTK is
copyrighted, anyone is allowed to use it for any purpose, including
commercial ones, as well as to modify and redistribute it (a more
precise description is given in the copyright statement that comes
with the code).
</p>



<p>
This manual describes version 2.4 of MMTK. The 2.x versions contain
some incompatible changes with respect to earlier versions (1.x), most
importantly a package structure that reduces the risk of name
conflicts with other Python packages, and facilitates future
enhancements. There are also many new features and improvements to
existing functions.
</p>



<p>
Using MMTK requires a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming
and Python. Newcomers to this subject should have a look at the 
introductory section in this manual and at the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/tut.html">Python tutorial</a> (which also comes
with the Python interpreter). There are also numerous
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/Books.html">books on Python</a>
that are useful in getting started. Even without MMTK, Python is a very
useful programming language for scientific use, allowing rapid development
and testing and easy interfacing to code written in low-level languages such
as Fortran or C.
</p>



<p>
This manual consists of several introductory chapters and a <a href="MMTK_10.html#module_reference">Module Reference</a>. The introductory chapters explain how
common tasks are handled with MMTK, but they do not describe
all of its features, nor do they contain a full documentation of
functions or classes. This information can be found in
the <a href="MMTK_10.html#module_reference">Module Reference</a>, which describes all classes
and functions intended for end-user applications module by module,
using documentation extracted directly from the source code.
References from the introductory sections to the module reference
facilitate finding the relevant documentation.
