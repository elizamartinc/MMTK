<ul>


<li> <p>

<a name="Function:MMTK.DCD.writeDCDPDB"><b><i>writeDCDPDB</i></b>()</a><br>


</p>



<p>Write the configurations in <i>conf_list</i> (any sequence of Configuration
objects) to a newly created DCD trajectory file with the name
<i>dcd_file_name</i>. Also write the first configuration to a PDB file
with the name <i>pdb_file_name</i>; this PDB file has the same atom order
as the DCD file. The time step between configurations can be specified
by <i>delta_t</i>.
</p>

<li> <p>

<a name="Function:MMTK.DCD.writeVelocityDCDPDB"><b><i>writeVelocityDCDPDB</i></b>()</a><br>


</p>



<p>Write the velocities in <i>vel_list</i> (any sequence of ParticleVector
objects) to a newly created DCD trajectory file with the name
<i>dcd_file_name</i>. Also write the first configuration to a PDB file
with the name <i>pdb_file_name</i>; this PDB file has the same atom order
as the DCD file. The time step between configurations can be specified
by <i>delta_t</i>.

<a name="Class:MMTK.DCD.DCDReader"><h2>Class DCDReader: Reader for DCD trajectories (CHARMM/X-Plor)</h2></a>





<p>A DCDReader reads a DCD trajectory and "plays back" the
data as if it were generated directly by an integrator.
The universe for which the DCD file is read must be
perfectly compatible with the data in the file, including
an identical internal atom numbering. This can be guaranteed
only if the universe was created from a PDB file that is
compatible with the DCD file without leaving out any
part of the system.</p>



<p>Constructor: DCDReader(<i>universe</i>, <i>**options</i>)</p>



<p><dl>


<dt><i>universe</i></dt>


<dd><p>
the universe for which the information from the
              trajectory file is read</p></dd>


<dt><i>options</i></dt>


<dd><p>
keyword options:<ul>


<li> <p>
dcd_file:  the name of the DCD trajecory file to be read
</p>

<li> <p>
actions: a list of actions to be executed periodically (default is
             none)</p>

</ul>


</p></dd>


</dl>
</p>



<p>Reading is started by calling the reader object.
All the keyword options listed above can be specified either when
creating the reader or when calling it.</p>



<p>The following data categories and variables are available for
output:</p>



<ul>


<li> <p>
category "time": time</p>

<li> <p>
category "configuration": configuration
</p>

</ul>
