<h2>Functions</h2>





<ul>


<li> <p>

<a name="Function:MMTK.Solvation.numberOfSolventMolecules"><b><i>numberOfSolventMolecules</i></b>()</a><br>


</p>



<p>Returns the number of solvent molecules of type <i>solvent</i>
that must be added to <i>universe</i>, in addition to whatever it
contains already, to obtain the specified solvent <i>density</i>.</p>

<li> <p>

<a name="Function:MMTK.Solvation.addSolvent"><b><i>addSolvent</i></b>()</a><br>


</p>



<p>Scales up the universe by <i>scale_factor</i> and adds as many
molecules of type <i>solvent</i> (a molecul object or a string)
as are necessary to obtain the specified solvent <i>density</i>,
taking account of the solute molecules that are already present
in the universe. The molecules are placed at random positions
in the scaled-up universe, but without overlaps between
any two molecules.</p>

<li> <p>

<a name="Function:MMTK.Solvation.shrinkUniverse"><b><i>shrinkUniverse</i></b>()</a><br>


</p>



<p>Shrinks <i>universe</i>, which must have been scaled up by
Function:MMTK.Solvation.addSolvent, back to its original size.
The compression is performed in small steps, in between which
some energy minimization and molecular dynamics steps are executed.
The molecular dynamics is run at the given <i>temperature</i>, and
an optional <i>trajectory</i> (a MMTK.Trajectory.Trajectory object or
a string, interpreted as a file name) can be specified in which
intermediate configurations are stored.
