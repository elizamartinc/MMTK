* Path integrals

** Force fields

*** DONE Nonbonded lists
Iteration over pairs should include only pairs with compatible bead
indices. Problem: index compatibility is a rather complex and thus
costly computation. A lookup table could be used, but may result in
bad cache performance.

*** DONE Check that the bead numbers of all atoms in the universe are consistent

*** TODO Merge path integral setup in EnergyEvaluator and EnergyEvaluatorParameters

** ParticleProperty

*** TODO Indexing with a multi-bead atom
Idea: define intensive and extensive quantities, with intensive ones returning the
average over the beads and extensive ones the sum. This could also be extended to
allow indexing of ParticleProperties with multi-atom objects (though the weights for
calculating averages are not obvious).

** Trajectories

*** DONE Reading a ParticleTrajectory for a bead

*** TODO Reading a ParticleTrajectory for a multi-bead atom
Same problem as for ParticleProperties.

** Integration

*** TODO Integrator using fourier-transform variables

*** TODO Constraints

*** TODO Langevin integration for rigid bodies (quaternions)

** Tests

*** TODO Coordinate manipulation (methods in Collections.GroupOfAtoms)
 - [X] translation
 - [X] rotation
 - [ ] center of mass
 - [ ] moment of inertia
 - [ ] bounding box
 - [ ] bounding sphere
 - [ ] rms difference
 - [ ] findTransformation
 - [ ] kineticEnergy
 - [ ] temperature
 - [ ] momentum
 - [ ] angularMomentum
 - [ ] angularVelocity
 - [ ] booleanMask

*** TODO Energy evaluation

*** TODO Trajectories

*** TODO ParticleProperties


* New features

** TODO [#C] Make energy gradients available for subsets of the total force field


* Bugs

** TODO [#C] Opening a trajectory written for a universe created from a MoleculeFactory doesn't work.

** TODO Trajectory test fails for ParallelepipedicPeriodicUniverse in readParticleTrajectory
