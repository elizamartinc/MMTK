* Path integrals

** Force fields

*** TODO Nonbonded list optimization
The current algorithm leads to a quadratic complexity as a function of
bead number.

*** DONE Check that the bead numbers of all atoms in the universe are consistent

*** TODO Merge path integral setup in EnergyEvaluator and EnergyEvaluatorParameters

*** TODO Look at Ewald summation
Either make it work or make it fail with an exception when there are path integrals

*** DONE Check that subsets are treated correctly

** ParticleProperty

*** TODO Indexing with a multi-bead atom
Idea: define intensive and extensive quantities, with intensive ones returning the
average over the beads and extensive ones the sum. This could also be extended to
allow indexing of ParticleProperties with multi-atom objects (though the weights for
calculating averages are not obvious).

** Trajectories

*** DONE Reading a ParticleTrajectory for a bead

*** TODO Reading a ParticleTrajectory for a multi-bead atom
Same problem as for ParticleProperties.

** Integration

*** TODO Integrator using fourier-transform variables

*** TODO Constraints

*** TODO Langevin integration for rigid bodies (quaternions)

** Tests

*** TODO Coordinate manipulation (methods in Collections.GroupOfAtoms)
 - [X] translation
 - [X] rotation
 - [ ] center of mass
 - [ ] moment of inertia
 - [ ] bounding box
 - [ ] bounding sphere
 - [ ] rms difference
 - [ ] findTransformation
 - [ ] kineticEnergy
 - [ ] temperature
 - [ ] momentum
 - [ ] angularMomentum
 - [ ] angularVelocity
 - [ ] booleanMask

*** TODO Energy evaluation

*** TODO Trajectories

*** TODO ParticleProperties

** I/O

*** TODO PDB output

* New features

** TODO [#C] Make energy gradients available for subsets of the total force field


* Improvements

** DONE [#A] Alert for data base conflicts
At every database access, check if there are multiple definitions in
different directories of the search path and alert the user of the
possible conflict.

* Bugs

** TODO [#C] Opening a trajectory written for a universe created from a MoleculeFactory doesn't work.

** TODO Trajectory test fails for ParallelepipedicPeriodicUniverse in readParticleTrajectory
